# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

To split the lab up, some members of our team worked on part 1 (those with windows computers) and the others worked on part 2 with the rdc and excel analysis. Overall, the team worked well together to complete the lab and the work was split evenly. We met in the lab to work and ask questions and communicated efficiently outside of the lab time to complete the final report.  

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We encountered a lot of problems with running the software. Though we had a general understanding of what needed to be done, it was unclear and a bit confusing when it came down to working on the lab. As well, some of the software did not work with mac os, so we had to work around that (splitting up the workload with the other parts of the lab).

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Overall, we thought the lab was interesting, but we had a lot of issues in the beginning with the setup. In the future, more detailed instructions would be appreciated to better understand how to use the software. It took us a while to figure out how to exactly how to run everything properly.
